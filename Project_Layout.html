                <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically 
                    carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). 
                    Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of 
                    operations known as programs. These programs enable computers 
                    to perform a wide range of tasks.<br>
                    Hardware

                    All those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects are covered under the term hardware. The hardware includes circuits, computer chips, graphics cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboards, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and "mice" input devices.
                    
                    
                     <br>There are five main hardware components: 
                    
                    
                    <br>Input Devices: 
                    
                    <br>These are devices that are used to enter data/information in the 
                    central processing unit. Example- keyboard, mouse, scanner, document reader, 
                    barcode reader, optical character reader, magnetic reader etc.
                    
                    
                    <br>Output Devices: 
                    
                    These are devices that provide the processed data/information into human-readable form. Example- monitor, printer, speaker, projector etc.
